# Optimizing policy restrictions for pandemics, based on agent based model and VNS algorithm

The propagation of viruses, such as Covid-19, can vary significantly based on group segmentation, including age, geographical location, and socioeconomic status. Different groups may have different levels of vulnerability, exposure, and risk factors that influence the spread of viruses. Therefore, it is crucial to tailor restricting policies accordingly when implementing measures to mitigate virus propagation. 

This project presents a methodology for finding optimal sets of activity reduction measures based on group segmentation. The optimization framework utilizes the Variable Neighborhood Search (VNS) algorithm to identify the optimal parameters that reduce both the number of cases and deaths from a pandemic, as well as the economic costs of implementing measures. The economic spread modeling is based on an Agent-Based Model (ABM). The proposed methodology offers a systematic approach for optimizing pandemic mitigation strategies by considering group segmentation and economic factors.


## Deployment

To deploy the optimization process and find the policies adapt and run:

```bash
  optimization_process.ipynb
```
